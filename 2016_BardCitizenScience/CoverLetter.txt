Director, Citizen Science Program
Visiting Assistant Professor of Biology
RKC 202, Bard College

Dear Dr. Savage,

		This is an application for the 2017 Bard College Citizen Science Faculty. I am currently a postdoctoral research fellow at the National Institutes of Health and I have been actively exploring opportunities in STEM education. My broad background and my science and teaching experiences make me an ideal fit for this program.
		
		I am particularly interested in particpating in the Citizen Science program because it aligns very well with my skills and interests. I earned my medical degree from Colombia's National University (Universidad Nacional de Colombia), and practiced for 6 months as in intern in a rural hospital in Colombia, where a big number of cases included the diagnosis and management of infectious diseases, which was the topic focus of Citizen Science in 2016. I then earned my doctoral degree in Physiology and Biophysics from the University of Washington, where I focused on the study of phototransduction. Now as a postdoctoral research fellow at the National Institutes of Health, I am currently trying to expand my studies into the processing of signals in the visual system. My expertise in science is about a 50:50 mix of bench experiments (including electrophysiological recordings of live cells) and computational work (including in-depth data analysis and construction of mathematical models), which seem to be the core activities in the program.
		More importantly, I am very passionate on STEM education. I

Opening Paragraph. Attract attention. Clearly state the reason for writing, naming the
position or type of work for which you are applying. Identify how you heard of the
opening or how the employer’s name was obtained (i.e., the Career Services Center
informed me of your opening or Professor Smith in the Technology Department at
Western Washington University recommended that I contact you.)

Second Paragraph. State your reason for writing this particular employer. Specify
concrete reasons for the type of work you desire. Highlight: your skills; your goals;
and/or how your education, experiences and other qualifications support your capacity

can do for the employer rather than what the employer can do for you. Significant
accomplishments can be noted, but the resume should not be repeated any more than
absolutely necessary. Basically, you are emphasizing your key qualifications -- selling
yourself -- elaborating on background areas which will attract the employer for the
specific career field or job you want.
