2016_Meister notes and questions

	What is the Erath's magnetic field and comparisons
	Magnetotactic bacteria (Bazylinski nad Frankel, 2004)
		Ferrimagnetic crystals of magnetite in a chain
	Dunlop, 1972:
		Smallest iron particles with magnetic moment at room temp = magnetite (Fe3O4) crystals (30 nm)
		1x10^6 iron atoms, packed (ch37 of Feynman vol2)
		
Feynman:
	Ferromagnetic materials are special: unlike normal materials, neighboring atoms tend to have parallel electron spins in a magnetic field
