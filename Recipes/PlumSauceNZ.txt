Plum Sauce

http://luckypeach.com/recipes/plum-sauce-92/

INGREDIENTS Makes about 4 quarts
1 T grapeseed oil
2 medium Vidala onions, halved and thinly sliced
3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
2 T salt
2 t cayenne pepper
2 t ground cloves
2 t ground ginger
2 t ground black pepper
3 1/2 lbs sugar
6 1/2 lbs red or purple plums, pitted
6 C malt vinegar
PREPARATION
Heat a large heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat, then add the oil. After a minute, add the onions and garlic and cook, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the onions are soft and golden.
Add the salt, dry spices, and sugar, stirring well; then add the plums and vinegar and turn the heat up to high. Once the pot has come to a good strong boil, lower the heat to a bare simmer and cover it. Cook for 45 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure it’s not sticking to the sides and bottom. Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for 10 minutes, with the lid slightly ajar.
Get out your immersion blender, go in, and purée the contents. If you don’t have one, ladle sauce a little at a time into a blender. All roads lead to Rome.
Once you’ve got a smooth purée, attach a medium-sized funnel to a hot, clean bottle of your choice (I give mine a standing rinse with boiling water first) and begin ladling till filled, then seal. Repeat until all sauce is bottled. Store at room temperature. The longer it’s kept, the better the taste.
