Pâte à Choux aka Churro Dough

Ingredients:
4.5 oz (125 g) water
4.5 oz (125 g) milk
2 oz (60 g) salted butter
1 tsp (3 g) fine salt
4.5 oz (125 g) pastry flour
7.5 oz (223 g) eggs (about 4 extra-large eggs)

Cinnamon-Sugar Coating
1 tbsp (8 g) cinnamon
4 tbsp (120 g) sugar
1 tsp (4 g) salt

Instructions:
1) In a medium saucepan, combine the water, milk, butter, and salt, and bring to a boil. Add the flour and stir it in with a wooden spoon until a smooth dough forms; stir over low heat until it dries out and pulls away from the pan, about 2 min.
2) Scrape the dough into a bowl; let cool for 1 min. Beat the eggs into the dough, one at a time, beating thoroughly between each egg.
3) Transfer the dough to a pastry bag. 
4) Bring a pot of fry oil up to 336 °F / 169 °C. Pipe the dough directly into the fry oil, or pipe shapes onto squares of oil-sprayed parchment paper and gently slip them into the pot. @Danatough made crullers by piping in a circular shape. 
5) Combine the cinnamon, sugar, and salt, then toss ’em in that goodness. Dip ’em in chocolate. Drench ’em in dulce de leche. 
Churro-cheers!
