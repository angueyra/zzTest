Floury baps (Paul Hollywood)


375g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting
7g fast-action dried yeast
7g salt
30g caster sugar
30g vegetarian shortening, softened and cut into pieces

Step 1
Make the baps. Tip the flour into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt and sugar to the other. Add the shortening and 250ml of water and turn the mixture around with your fingertips, gradually incorporating the flour until you have a soft, but not soggy dough (you may not need all the water).

Step 2
Tip out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 8–10 minutes, until silky and smooth. Place it in the prepared bowl, cover with cling film and leave to rise in a warm place or proving drawer for about 1 hour, or until doubled in size.

Step 3
Meanwhile, divide the risen dough into 8 equal pieces and shape each piece into a loose ball: to do this, place each piece on the work surface and cover it in a cage formed by your cupped hand. Move your hand in a circular motion, rotating the ball rapidly to shape it (this will also naturally knock out the air).

Step 4
Set the rolls aside on a floured surface, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rest for 10 minutes.

Step 5
Using a rolling pin, flatten each ball of dough and place it on a prepared baking sheet. Leave enough space between each roll for expansion. Place each baking sheet in a proving bag and leave in a warm place to prove for 45 minutes, until risen to almost double in size.

Step 6
Heat the oven to 220°C/200°C/Gas 7. Lightly dust the surface of the rolls with flour, then bake them for 10–15 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Leave to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
