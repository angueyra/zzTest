Pizzelle recipe
	3 eggs
	180 g (3/4 cup) brown sugar
	120 g (1/2 cup) butter, melted then cooled (could try 1:4 oil:butter)
	420 g (1 3/4 cup) all purpose flour
     10 g (2 tsp) baking powder
	0.5 g (1/2 tsp) salt
	Flavoring:
		10 g (2 tsp) vanilla extract
		or
		10 g (2 tsp) almond extract
		or
		12.5 g (1.5 tsp) tsp ground cinnamon
		and/or
		citrus zest

	Instructions:

	- Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt, set aside.
	- In a large mixing bowl using an electric hand mixer beat the eggs and sugar on low speed until thick and creamy. Using a spoon stir in melted butter and vanilla. Using the hand mixer on low speed add the flour mixture to the egg mixture and blend until smooth.
	- Lightly brush your pizzelle iron with melted butter or oil(I like butter), and make sure iron is really hot before you begin cooking pizzelles. Repeat for each batch you cook.
	Note: if batter feels too thick, add 3-4 tbsp of water. Pizzelles will turn out crispier. Could replace water by shot of rum/whiskey.
