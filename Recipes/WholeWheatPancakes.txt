100 Perfect Whole Wheat Pancakes

2 cups whole wheat flour*
2 tbsp sugar
1-1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp baking soda
3/4 tsp salt
2-1/4 cups low-fat buttermilk
5 tbsp vegetable or canola oil
2 large eggs

1. Whisk flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together in medium bowl. Add eggs, buttermilk, and oil; whisk until smooth. (Mixture will be thick; do not add more buttermilk.)
2. Heat 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat (or electric griddle set at 350 degrees).
3. Using 1/4 cup measuring cup or scoop, portion batter into pan . Cook until edges are set, first side is golden brown, and bubbles on surface are just beginning to break, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip pancakes and continue to cook until second side is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Serve pancakes immediately or transfer to wire rack in 200 degree oven. Repeat with remaining batter. Makes ~18 pancakes.
Note: Make sure your whole wheat flour is very fresh for best flavor.
